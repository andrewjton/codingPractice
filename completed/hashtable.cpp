/*
FEATURES
Open addressing (linear probing)
hashing fxn is a power of 37
Why is table size prime? --> reduces possible collisions if the tablesize & the hashing functions are coprime!

future implementation:
1. resize automatically if half full --> reduces collisions
2. quadratic probing --> more spread
3. implement delete (requires you to have sentinel values (easiest))
